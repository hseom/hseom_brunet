A Simulator for Brunet using virtual time caused by namespace confusion,
specifically the use of Brunet.DateTime to hide System.DateTime.  Most commands
are made clear on the command line and user interface.
Checkout
$ mono Simulator.exe --help
and when in the Simulator type:
#: HELP

What's not listed are Run and RunSteps
RUN will execute all tasks that occur in the next epoch (minimum time we have
to move to cause a new event to occur)
RUN with an integer parameter (like RUN 1000000) will execute 1000000 ms or
16.667 minutes (each cycle is 1 ms)

To compile execute nant simulator in Brunet's root directory.  Note, the
Brunet.dll generated will NOT work with any other code in the codebase, you
will need to recompile to perform other tasks.
